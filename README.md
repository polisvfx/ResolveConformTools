# Resolve VFX Conform Helpers

A small assortment of scripts that might be helpful for everyday conform and onlining tasks. This is being develeoped from the viewpoint of a VFX artist working in the realm of car, beauty and other commericals/ads/TVCs.

## Create all Clips Timeline
This script will create a Timeline with all used clips based on selection or bin.
This script builds upon work done by [Thatcher Freeman](https://github.com/thatcherfreeman/resolve-scripts "Thatcher Freeman"), definetly check him out!
- Custom sorting
- Threshold to combine clips (eg. 25 frames would merge multiple edits of the same source that have a gap of less then 25 frames between them)
- Option to mark multiple instances of the same source
- Exclude Audio if you are only interested in the video
- Option to Include clips that are disabled on the timeline

## Shot Naming
The script will insert custom numbering into the "Shot" Metadata field. A shortcoming of Resolve is that theres no API access to set any custom timeline based values to a script that can also be read via Tokens (eg. on the Deliver Page) so we are stuck with setting this data on a global/media bin level. This is problematic if you deal with source material that is used multiple times as the unique numbering can only be applied once and not for each instance.
For each additional instance of a source clip, resolve will skip a count and add a marker to the clip in question containing the would be number.

Once the script has run its course you could batch rename the clip events by selecting them and entering the Clip Attributes. There you would use any naming of your choice in combination with the %Shot token.

If you are only using trims, duplicates shouldnt be of concern.

## Copy to Nuke Simple
This grabs the selected clips filepath and edit information along with its reelname and puts it into the workstations clipboard in a Nuke-readable format. You can then simple paste it into your Nuke nodegraph.

It also sets a readnode Input Transform, creates a group that makes sure the Clip starts at frame 1001 (+-Handles)
Handles and Colorspace are exposed at the top of the script for you to edit to your liking.

## Copy Clip and Settings to Nuke Python
This is an advanced version that does the same as the simple version but also alters the Nuke Scripts settings: Plate Format, FPS, Framerange.
Because of this functionality, the clipboard contents have to be copied into the script editor end run from there.
This is mainly for setting up new scripts as it will override settings.

It also sets a readnode Input Transform, creates a group that makes sure the Clip starts at frame 1001 (+-Handles)

## Future Features
The nuke integration is in its infancy and I am contemplating making it a bit more robust and useful, maybe creating a script that will generate a project config file that handles all variables like, project resolution, handles and so on. You could theoretically also reference nukescript templates and generate nuke scripts out of Resolve.
